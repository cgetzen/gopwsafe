A password safe written in go using  and implementing the http://pwsafe.org/[password safe] version 3 database.
Simply download and run, no install needed.

The pwsafe package contains interfaces for reading/writing to Password Safe v3 databases.
This package is utilized by both the gtk based gui.

The gui is implemented with the library https://github.com/gotk3/gotk3[gotk3]

The project has been largely tested and developed on Linux (Ubuntu).

== GTK GUI
Features:

- The ability to have multiple windows open with different databases in each is a key feature that many other Password Safe implementations don't have.
- Simple database search.
- Tree representation based on db and group.
- Keyboard shortcuts, for copy/paste, opening url in a browser, etc.

== Installation
https://github.com/gotk3/gotk3[Gotk3] requires GTK3 to be installed, on linux this is standard likely there is nothing you need to do.
For a mac gtk3 should be explicitly installed, for example with brew:

----
brew install gtk+3
brew install adwaita-icon-theme
----

After the dependencies are installed run the compiled binary as normal. If you wish to make it into a mac application, I suggest following http://brizzled.clapper.org/blog/2008/10/22/wrapping-an-executable-inside-a-mac-os-x-application/[these instructions].

== References
- V3 Password Safe Specification - https://github.com/pwsafe/pwsafe/blob/master/docs/formatV3.txt

== Roadmap
- Add a timeout to clear the clipboard a minute or so after copying a password.
- The ability copy/move entries from one open db to another.
- Make the Mac version more mac like, ie don't startup unfocused, top level menu, working command key not just control, etc.
- A status bar to display messages, ie 'Copied Password to Clipboard', etc.
- Automatic storage of old passwords.
- Add a file selection tool for opening.
- The ability to diff two different databases.
  - Full diff
  - diff based on particular fields, name, username, url, password
- Edit of multiple entries at once for select fields, ie modify the group

== Building

Go dependencies are managed with https://github.com/golang/dep[dep], ie run `dep ensure`.

The gotk3 project is dependent on gtk3 and so that must be installed to build.
Details on this installation are in the gotk3 https://github.com/gotk3/gotk3/wiki#installation[project wiki].

After the dependencies are installed a normal go build is all that is needed.

To debug the GUI run with the environment `GTK_DEBUG=interactive`.
